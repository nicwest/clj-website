      I'm a most-of-stack web developer with thirst for writing terrible code.
      I'm acutely aware of how little I contribute to the Open Source community
      and this is something I'm looking to remedy. I have three and bit years
      of B2B startup experience in the publishing sector, and I'm currently
      employed at Leto Lab LTD in London as junior web developer.
